        <img src="images/smile.jpg" class="profile-picture" alt="Will smiling">

          <p>Bay Area native born and raised - I am thankful for my family and for the time
              and place where I was raised. As a Filipino-American the Bay Area is and always be a home
              close to my heart. I love the culture where I live, and intend to raise my kids in or near Silicon Valley/Bay Area.</p>

          <p>In 2012, I graduated from the University of San Francisco with a BA in Politics. My extracurricular activities and hobbies include martial arts, music and flying.
              In college I competed on the USF collegiate boxing team for 2 years and currently teach Filipino Martial Arts
              and boxing at an MMA gym in Concord, CA. I enjoy many genres of music including rap, rock and classical music; I play guitar, piano and violin as a soloist. At age 19,
              I earned a commercial pilot license after graduating from Pacific States Avaiation Flight Academy, which I attended in tandem with my high school studies.</p>

          <p>My personal beleifs include Gnositicism - an original faith that no longer has an active church. The first gnositcs modeled their faith after the life of Jesus Christ prior to the founding
             of the Roman Catholic Church. I also have tremenduous faith in science and human ingenuity, and beleive that if these are driven by altruistic members of humanity - we
             can indeed make our future bright and full of hope for generations to come.</p>
